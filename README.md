Hello, my name is Aleksadner, and I'm a developer of this pygame platformer.

Use to install necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

In the game, you can control the character by using the buttons A, D and SPACE. Also, you have only 3 tries to pass the level. If you failed just try again by pressed button X

Enjoy :)
